# WebLogic Migration Tooling

This folder contains the lab giving you hands-on experience of the tools needed to migrate WebLogic environments: WebLogic Deployment Tool and Image Tool.



This lab is composed of the following steps : 



- **Prerequisites** : you will create a compute instance where we will spin up 2 WebLogic environments, so we can use these environments to execute the migration.  
  [Steps to follow to set up the instance](test_wls_docker_image-stack/Readme.md)



- **Part 1 : Using the WDT** tool to migrate a WebLogic domain from a source to a target server
  [Lab Execution steps](WLS_deploy_scripts)



- Part 2 : Image Toolkit : creating docker images with WebLogic software, patch these distribution with the latest PSU, and deploy Weblogic Domains and you will store them to Oracle OCI Registry
   [Lab Execution steps](WLS_imagetool_scripts).

  



You can find extra information to help you during the execution of the steps of your labs in the [Troubleshooting](troublshooting.md) section
